# Localizer
This paradimn was created with PsychoPy 3 (https://www.psychopy.org/index.html). It implements a language localizer fMRI paradigmn according to Fedorenko et al. (https://evlab.mit.edu/alice). 

Sound stimuli should be placed in a 'stimuli' subdirectory, each language also in a subdirectory, e.g. 'stimuli/German/'.
